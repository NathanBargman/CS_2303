This program runs "The Game of Life"
	rules can be found at http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html
It can be run with the command line and arguments 
	./HW2 NR NC gens inputfile [print] [pause]
NR = number of rows
NC = number of columns
gens = the number of desired rounds
inputfile = the file to read the original game board
print = 'y' or 'n' to print or not after each round, respectivly
pause = 'y' or 'n' to pause or not after each round, respectivly

This game is suppose to run on an infinite board, so results will be completely accurate on a finite board

I had some trouble implementing the pointer switching, I believe I have gotten it working. Other than that I used the friday starter code. I changed a few things around as well as completing it.
